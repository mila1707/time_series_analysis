Dear Potential MIDAS User,

Please find in this directory all the files you need to get started with MIDAS.  A listing of files with brief description is given at the end of this README file.

The code is written in Fortran, and can be called from a C-shell script.  It has been tested on Linux and on Mac OSx.  The executable is only for Linux (it is 32 bit, but it is possible to run it on a 64 bit machine if you have 32 bit library installed, for example, on Linux/Fedora, "sudo yum install glibc.i686"). The compile script requires installation of gfortran (either for Linux or Mac OSx).

You can test MIDAS using a input file DUTC.IGS08.tenv, and optional input step file DUTC.IGS08.step (you can try without this too!).  Sample output file are provided for comparison (take care not to overwrite these!).

The code is freely available, however, you must retain the copyright statement on line 3 if you use part of the code.   Also, please give credit to the MIDAS paper both in your code and in documentation or papers usingthe MIDAS technique.

In the paper it was impossible to describe in natural language exactly what the code does.  I hope you can interpret the Fortran code to understand the algorithm exactly.  Hopefully, the combination of code and paper will help you to understand it.

You can find MIDAS solutions for ~15,000 stations around the world that are update every week on our web page http://geodesy.unr.edu. Look at the right-hand side for MIDAS.

If you publish a paper using MIDAS, please cite the open-access paper MIDAS.pdf as follows:

Thanks for your interest, and I look forward to your feedback!
